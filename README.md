A big **chain veld**, using all **executable velds** that were defined as examples, and wires them
all together in one single long processing chain. 

Note that this **chain veld** uses a temporary directory (`./data_tmp/`) in its own repo to store
the serialized data in between the various processing steps. Only the final output is stored in a
dedicated **data veld**.
